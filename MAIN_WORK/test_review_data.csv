Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.	0	5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw	0	4	2012-08-01	review	0

4U9kSBLuBDU391x6bxU-YA	fFSoGV46Yxuwbr3fHNuZig	Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.	0	5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw	0	5	2015-10-31	review	0

The ""Wet Cajun"" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!
The dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  ""Pittsburgh Dad"" would love this place n'at!!"	0	UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ	0	5	2013-11-08	review	0
SIBCL7HBkrP4llolm4SC2A	0Lua2-PbqEQMjD9r89-asw	We checked this place out this past Monday for their wing night. We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon.	0	UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ	0	3	2014-03-29	review	0
8J4IIYcqBlFch8T90N923A	7N9j5YbBHBW6qguE5DAeyA	Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.	0	UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ	0	1	2014-10-29	review	0

Looking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries.
